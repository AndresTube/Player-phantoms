👻 Player Phantoms (English)

🌟 Project Summary

Player Phantoms is a simple yet engaging Spigot/Paper plugin that makes death matter. When a player dies, a hostile NPC (a Zombie with the player's skin and enhanced stats) spawns at the death location. This hostile "Shadow" is a direct consequence of the player's demise, forcing them to face their own reflection to recover their lost status.

✨ Features

    Hostile Shadow Spawn: A Zombie is spawned instantly at the player's death location.

    Custom Appearance: The Zombie wears the head of the deceased player, allowing for easy identification.

    Enhanced Difficulty: The Shadow is given increased Max Health (40 HP) and Movement Speed, making it a genuine threat.

    Metadata Tagging: The spawned entity is tagged with custom metadata, allowing other plugins to recognize the hostile shadow.

    Lightweight: Minimal impact on server performance.
